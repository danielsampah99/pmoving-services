				"Dan, Zach and Maurice were a great crew. Had to move a relative from a large apartment to a studio in assisted living. In the process we had to make a stop at a storage facility to unload 3/4 of her possessions. The guys worked as a great team to get all of the boxes, totes and furniture into a space that was likely smaller than it should have been. Maurice had a plan and all three worked in unison to pack the unit with room to spare, which was of great benefit to the owner to not have to rent a larger unit. The crew continued on to the final location and placed what was needed to set up the room for the night. They were a great crew and easy to work with. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a more successful move, thanks to Premium Moving and the crew of Dan, Zach and Maurice.",

They were not only expert movers - and really careful in prepping and moving all our furniture (they wrapped every furniture piece in blankets and/or plastic) they also offered to move things that I hadn't considered - like ALL of my houseplants -large and small! Then...a mouse snuck into the house (because the door was ajar) and THEY CAUGHT HIM! : ) Truly above and beyond! On top of all that everyone was extremely pleasant and really lovely to work with.

Rodney his truck driver & Forman along with two of his comrades were Fantastic! They were fast & thorough! It was 2 hrs to load & 4 hrs to unload as we moved into a 2nd floor apartment where they had to use the elevator & move all the furniture & boxes down the hall at least 60 yards away! Rodney has been with Chester when they first started over 5 years ago! They were an amazing team & very skilled movers. I bought them lunch but other then this they took no breaks! I needed to use two debit cards to pay the final bill & Chester was flexible & understanding. I would hire Chester & his team over again in a heartbeat.",
